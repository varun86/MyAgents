/**
 * titleFilters — error-shaped text patterns to reject as session titles.
 *
 * Defense-in-depth backstop for #245. The primary fix is the renderer-side
 * `shouldRecordTurnForTitle` gate (terminalReason.ts) which discards rounds
 * where the SDK reported a non-completed terminal_reason. That handles the
 * reported flow. This module covers two adjacent leaks:
 *
 *   1. Title-gen LLM echoes the input verbatim when fed garbage rounds (e.g.
 *      a max_turns turn whose only assistant content was an error message).
 *   2. The title-gen call itself hits the same upstream 4xx/5xx — SDK
 *      surfaces the error string as the title-gen assistant response and
 *      cleanTitle accepts it.
 *
 * Patterns are anchored at start-of-trimmed-string and case-insensitive.
 * Keep this list tight — false positives turn legitimate user titles into
 * "新对话". Each entry MUST trace back to a real production-observed surface
 * (see comments alongside).
