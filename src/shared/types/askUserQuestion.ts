/**
 * Re-key AskUserQuestion answers by question text for the SDK-binary contract.
 *
 * SDK 0.3.158's builtin `AskUserQuestion` tool — and the Claude Code CLI, which
 * is the same native binary — builds its tool_result by looking each answer up
 * under the question's TEXT:
 *
 *     questions.map(({ question }) => answers[question])   // answers[question.text]
 *
 * A missing key makes that question read back as unanswered, and when none
 * match the model is told "The user did not answer the questions." Our renderer
 * (AskUserQuestionPrompt) keys answers by `question.id ?? String(idx)` — the
 * neutral wire format the Codex runtime (codex.ts) consumes by id/index. So a
 * builtin/CC question (which has no id) arrives keyed by "0","1",… and never
 * matches the text lookup.
 *
 * This returns a SUPERSET: the original keys, plus a question-text alias for
 * every answered question. The SDK binary finds the text alias; Codex still
 * finds its id/index keys (it reads `answers[id] ?? answers[String(idx)]`), so
 * the one payload satisfies both contracts and Codex is left untouched.
 *
 * Regression context: the 0.2.119→0.3.158 upgrade switched the builtin tool's
 * lookup from numeric index to question text, so every index-keyed answer
 * silently became "did not answer".
