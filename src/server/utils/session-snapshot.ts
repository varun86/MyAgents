 * wants, and a compile error is the only thing that can silently change
 * behavior when a new field is added.
 *
 * Callers feed the returned `Partial<SessionMetadata>` to
 * `createSessionMetadata(agentDir, snapshot)`. Hand-assembling snapshot
 * fields outside these helpers is forbidden (see PRD §6.2 Pit-of-success).

 *   - `/api/session/freeze` endpoint (v0.2.14+ runtime-change detach)
 *   - Rust `OwnedSessionSnapshot` in `src-tauri/src/im/runtime_change.rs`

 * `configSnapshotAt` is INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED from this Pick — it's the
 * "this session is frozen" marker, stamped by the writer (sidecar
 * `/api/session/freeze` and Rust file-lock fallback) at write time, not
 * passed through the snapshot payload. Mixing it into the payload caused
 * TS↔Rust drift in the v0.2.14 first-cut review. (review-by-codex F2.)
