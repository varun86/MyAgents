/**
 * Issue #289 — what to do with the in-flight mid-turn queued item when the SDK's
 * `result` (turn-end) arrives during/after an interrupt.
 *
 * Background: a message sent mid-turn is yielded to the SDK ("in-flight to CLI") and
 * waits in the SDK commandQueue until the SDK either replays/dequeues it or the host
 * cancels it via cancel_async_message. A graceful interrupt still routes a `result`
 * through handleMessageComplete, but natural completion alone is not a consumption
 * acknowledgement. So whether the item should be SURFACED (shown as a user bubble),
 * DROPPED, or kept waiting depends on the terminal reason and user intent:
 *
 *  - Plain STOP: the user wants to stop; treat the in-flight item as "AI may not have
 *    seen it" and drop it from the UI (matches the long-standing stop behavior).
 *  - FORCE ("立即发送"): the user explicitly asked for THIS item to run now. force
 *    interrupts the current turn precisely so the SDK drains + processes the queued
 *    command — so it MUST be surfaced as a user bubble (the AI's reply renders under it).
 *    Dropping it is the #289 bug: "message vanishes from UI but the AI processed it".
 *  - Natural completion (not interrupting): keep waiting for SDK replay or the next
 *    assistant-turn signal. Do not surface merely because the previous turn ended.
 *
 * Pure decision core (Functional Core / Imperative Shell): the shell passes the live
 * flags; the caller performs the broadcast. This is ONLY for the result/complete handler.
 * The stop/error handlers fire when the item was lost with a force-closed subprocess
 * (rescuePendingToQueue does NOT rescue the in-flight item), so those always drop and
 * do not use this.
