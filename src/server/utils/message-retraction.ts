/**
 * Pure core for the SDK refusal-fallback retraction protocol (SDK 0.3.162+).
 *
 * When the primary model ends a stream with stop_reason "refusal", the SDK
 * retries the turn once on a fallback model and RETRACTS the already-delivered
 * messages of the refused leg. The retraction arrives through two idempotent,
 * overlapping channels:
 *
 *   1. `system/model_refusal_fallback` — `retracted_message_uuids` is the
 *      complete audit record for the turn (refused partials + tombstoned
 *      tool_results).
 *   2. The replacement assistant message's `supersedes?: UUID[]` field —
 *      names the messages it canonically replaces.
 *
 * Receivers must evict the named messages on arrival; eviction is idempotent
 * (unknown or already-removed uuids are a no-op).
 *
 * MyAgents mapping caveats:
 *
 * - One MessageWire bubble absorbs MULTIPLE SDK assistant messages within a
 *   turn, and `sdkUuid` keeps only the LATEST one (see `chat:message-sdk-uuid`
 *   semantics), so uuid matching identifies the refused bubble only when the
 *   refused leg delivered at least one final assistant frame.
 * - A refusal can cut the stream BEFORE any final assistant frame: the refused
 *   bubble then has no sdkUuid (or a stale one) and uuid matching misses it
 *   entirely. `fallbackToStreamingTail` covers this: a retraction event by
 *   protocol interrupts the CURRENT stream, so when the caller reports an
 *   active stream and no uuid matched the tail assistant bubble, the tail IS
 *   the refused content and is evicted too.
