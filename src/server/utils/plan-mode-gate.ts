/**
 * Plan-mode hard gate (issue #295) — pure decision core.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * MyAgents launches the Claude Agent SDK subprocess with
 * `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions: true` (so a mid-session switch to
 * fullAgency / `bypassPermissions` is honored without a restart — see the
 * comment at the `query()` options in agent-session.ts). At spawn time the SDK
 * translates that flag into the CLI arg `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`,
 * which sets the native CLI's `toolPermissionContext.isBypassPermissionsModeAvailable = true`.
 *
 * The native permission resolver then short-circuits:
 *
 *     // (decompiled from the bundled `claude` binary)
 *     function resolve(mode, isBypassAvailable) {
 *       if (mode === "auto") return "classify";
 *       if (mode === "bypassPermissions" || (mode === "plan" && isBypassAvailable)) return "allow";
 *       if (mode === "dontAsk") return "deny";
 *       return "ask"; // <- only "ask" sends a can_use_tool control_request to our canUseTool
 *     }
 *
 * So whenever bypass mode is "available", **plan mode resolves every ordinary
 * tool to "allow"** — the CLI never emits a `can_use_tool` control request, our
 * `canUseTool` callback (where MyAgents enforces the plan-mode read-only rules)
 * is NEVER invoked, and `result.permission_denials` stays empty. A well-behaved
 * Claude model honors the plan-mode system reminder ("you MUST NOT run any
 * non-readonly tools") and only calls ExitPlanMode, so the missing enforcement
 * is invisible. A weaker third-party model ignores the reminder and calls
 * `Bash rm -rf …` / `Edit` directly — and they execute unchecked (#295).
 *
 * THE FIX
 * -------
 * PreToolUse hooks run BEFORE the native permission resolver, and a hook
 * `permissionDecision: 'deny'` is honored regardless of the bypass-availability
 * short-circuit (`PreToolUse hook denies bypass canUseTool` per the SDK docs).
 * So a PreToolUse hook is the one place that can restore plan mode's read-only
 * guarantee WITHOUT giving up the always-on flag that fullAgency needs. Because
 * the hook reads the live permission mode on every tool call, it covers EVERY
 * way plan mode can be entered: agent config, the UI toggle, AND the AI's own
 * `EnterPlanMode` mid-turn (none of which a spawn-time flag could retro-fix on
 * the already-running subprocess).
 *
 * This module is the pure decision function (no I/O) so it can be unit-tested in
 * the fast pool; the imperative shell (the registered hook, logging) lives in
 * agent-session.ts. The allowlist is the single source of truth shared with
 * `getPermissionRules('plan')` so the canUseTool path and this hook can never
 * drift apart.

 * The live permission-mode union the sidecar mirror uses. agent-session.ts

/**
 * Fail-closed resolution of whether plan mode is in effect for a PreToolUse hook.
 *
 * The hook sees TWO sources of truth and they can desync mid-turn:
 *   - `hookMode` — the SDK's own per-call `PreToolUseHookInput.permission_mode`
 *     (BaseHookInput.permission_mode, sdk.d.ts), authoritative for the exact tool
 *     call about to run.
 *   - `localMode` — the sidecar's module-global mirror (`currentPermissionMode`),
 *     updated ASYNCHRONOUSLY from the status-message stream.
 *
 * They diverge in two windows, both fail-OPEN if we trust only `localMode`:
 *   1. The AI calls `EnterPlanMode` mid-turn; the SDK fires the next PreToolUse
 *      with `permission_mode: 'plan'` before the stream loop has updated the
 *      mirror (still `'auto'`) → a write tool slips through. This is the exact
 *      `plan + bypassAvailable ⇒ allow` hole #295 exists to close.
 *   2. `setSessionPermissionMode()` flips the mirror to `'auto'` OPTIMISTICALLY
 *      before `querySession.setPermissionMode()` is acked, while the CLI is still
 *      internally in plan.
 *
 * Treating plan as in effect when EITHER source says `'plan'` keeps the gate
 * fail-closed across both windows (worst case: one extra deny that the model
 * retries after ExitPlanMode — never an unchecked write).
