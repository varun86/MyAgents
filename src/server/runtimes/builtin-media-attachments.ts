/**
 * builtin-media-attachments — turn builtin in-process MCP media-tool output
 * (edge-tts audio / gemini-image image) into first-class `ToolAttachment[]`,
 * on the same pipeline as the Codex external runtime.
 *
 * PRD 0.2.30 (§3.1) + 0.2.31 cleanup. Parsing of the tool result text now lives
 * in the shared, single-source parser `@/shared/builtinMediaResult` (consumed by
 * both this server module and the renderer cards). This module owns only the
 * IO half: reading the generated file and saving a trusted-root copy.
 *
 * Why base64-copy into the trusted root (not a zero-copy externalPath ref):
 *  - the attachment endpoint resolves trusted-root files by path concat, so
 *    sidecar restart needs no `rebuildAttachmentRegistryFromBlocks`;
 *  - self-contained + GC-aligned; sidesteps the external-path allow-list (which
 *    doesn't cover arbitrary workspaces).
 * The original generated path is preserved on the attachment as `sourcePath`
 * (shown in the tool card + targeted by the "open path" menu).
 *
 * Failure is per-file graceful (log + skip): the tool card still shows the path.
 *
 * Security: the source path comes from OUR builtin tool's output (not model-
 * controlled), but is still validated defensively — absolute, under a known
 * generated dir, `lstat` rejects symlink leaf, regular file, size-capped before
 * the read (so a pathological file never gets fully loaded + base64-expanded).
