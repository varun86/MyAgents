// Durable backstop for tab restore (Issue #232 hardening).
//
// localStorage (tabPersistence.ts) is the PRIMARY store: written on every
// structural change and flushed on a clean quit, and it survives app updates.
// But the update-restart path (handleRestartAndUpdate → NSIS `exit(0)` on
// Windows / `relaunch()` on macOS) terminates the process ABRUPTLY, and
// WebKit/WebView2 persist localStorage to disk ASYNCHRONOUSLY (a coalescing
// flush timer). So the last `setItem` before that exit can be lost — the tabs
// the user had open at the moment they clicked "重启更新" then fail to restore
// on the next launch. (Normal Cmd+Q gives the WebView a clean teardown that
// flushes, which is why only the update path was reported broken.)
//
// This module adds a fsync-durable snapshot at `~/.myagents/open-tabs.json`,
// written (and AWAITED) right before the update-restart, and CONSUMED (deleted)
// on the next boot. It reuses the same atomic tmp+fsync+rename helper as
// config.json (configStore.safeWriteJson / safeLoadJson), so durability does
// not depend on WebView flush timing. Best-effort throughout: any failure
// degrades to the localStorage path and never breaks restart or boot.
//
// SINGLE-WRITER ASSUMPTION: unlike config.json this file deliberately does NOT
// take `withConfigLock`. It is written by exactly one process (the renderer) and
// the only caller that could overlap the write — the aborted-restart cleanup —
// now AWAITs its clear (App.tsx handleRestartAndUpdate), so the three operations
// (persist-before-restart / clear-on-abort / load-and-clear-on-boot) never
// interleave. This holds only while MyAgents is single-window/single-renderer;
// if multi-window ever lands, move these ops behind a lock or into a Rust command
// with locked read-clear-write semantics.
