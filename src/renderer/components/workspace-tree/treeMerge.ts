// Tree merge + frontier re-fetch utilities for DirectoryPanel refresh.
//
// Background: `cmd_workspace_dir_tree` caps depth at 4 and `cmd_workspace_dir_expand`
// caps depth at 3. So the renderer's `directoryInfo` is built incrementally:
// dirTree() returns the depth-4 skeleton; user expansion of a depth-5+ folder
// triggers dirExpand() which patches that sub-tree into `directoryInfo`. A naive
// "replace whole tree on refresh" wipes those patches and the visual tree
// collapses every time the fs watcher / tool-complete / 120s polling fires.
//
// This module provides the pieces to refresh non-destructively: keep stale lazy
// children as a fallback so the UI stays continuous, then re-fetch the frontier
// the user actually expanded so the visible state is fresh.

 *     The new fetch capped at the depth boundary; without this the
 *     previously expanded sub-tree would render as collapsed until
 *     `collectFreshUpdates` re-fetches it.
 *  2. Both sides have `children`      → recurse by path. Preserves
 *     deeper lazy patches inside an otherwise-fresh sub-tree. Returns
 *     the new node reference when no descendant actually changed, so
 *     downstream React-state comparisons stay cheap.
 *  3. Otherwise                       → return new as-is.
 *
 * Case 1 deliberately does NOT fire when the new node is `loaded:true` with
 * empty children — that means the dir was emptied on disk; carrying old
 * children would resurrect deleted files.
 *
 * Note: `DirectoryTreeNode.loaded` is typed `boolean | undefined` where
 * `true | undefined` both mean "fully loaded" per the type doc. Using
 * `!== false` keeps Case 1 robust if the Rust serialization ever omits
 * the flag for loaded dirs.
