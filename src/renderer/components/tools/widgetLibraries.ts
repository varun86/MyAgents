/**
 * Widget library resolution — replace a CDN `<script src>` for a small, trusted
 * set of charting/diagram libraries (Chart.js today) with the app's locally
 * BUNDLED source, injected INLINE, before the widget runs.
 *
 * Why inline (not a local `src=`): the widget iframe is
 * `sandbox="allow-scripts"` srcdoc → opaque origin, and it INHERITS the
 * top-frame CSP (`script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`). Chromium / WebView2
 * enforces that inherited policy on the iframe, so an external CDN `<script src>`
 * is blocked there (every chart widget would be blank on Windows), and a
 * locally-served `<script src='self'>` is ALSO blocked (the opaque origin's
 * `'self'` matches nothing). Only `'unsafe-inline'` is honoured. So we swap the
 * CDN `<script src>` for an inline `<script>` carrying the bundled source. This
 * also removes the network dependency entirely (offline / slow-CDN-in-China).
 *
 * WebKit (macOS) doesn't enforce inherited srcdoc CSP on external scripts, which
 * is why CDN charts work there today — but inlining is correct on every engine.
 *
 * The bundled source is lazy-loaded as a separate Vite chunk (`?raw`) so it
 * never bloats the initial renderer bundle, and is module-cached after first use.
 * Resolution runs at RENDER time in the renderer (not at generation time in the
 * sidecar) so we never persist ~200KB of inlined library into the session store,
 * and history widgets re-resolve on view.
 *
 * An UNKNOWN library (the open-ended "any package from cdnjs/jsdelivr/…" long
 * tail) is left untouched: its CDN `<script src>` stays, loads where allowed
 * (macOS), and fails visibly via the sandbox's widget:error notice where not.
