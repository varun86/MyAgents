//! Cross-platform wake-lock to prevent idle sleep during long-running tasks.
//!
//! Cron tasks (especially long-running ones like `/issue-triage`) can stall
//! when the host enters idle sleep: TCP streams to the Anthropic API die,
//! the SDK never detects the dead socket, and the 10-minute watchdog kills
//! the turn. Real incident: 2026-05-19 19:11–19:26, see
//! `~/.myagents/logs/unified-2026-05-19.log`.
//!
//! ## What this prevents
//!
//! Only **idle sleep** — the OS deciding the user is idle and putting the
//! machine to sleep on its own. User-initiated sleep (closing the lid,
//! pressing the power button, choosing Sleep from the menu) is **not**
//! blockable on any of the three platforms without elevated privileges,
//! and we don't try.
//!
//! ## Per-platform behavior
//!
//! | Platform | Mechanism | Limit |
//! |----------|-----------|-------|
//! | macOS    | `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` with `kIOPMAssertionTypePreventUserIdleSystemSleep` | Lid close still sleeps |
//! | Windows  | `SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS \| ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED \| ES_AWAYMODE_REQUIRED)` | Power Plan lid setting wins |
//! | Linux    | `systemd-inhibit --what=idle:sleep --mode=block <holder>` child | Requires systemd-logind; otherwise no-op |
//! | other    | No-op | — |
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::wake_lock::WakeLock;
//!
//! async fn run_cron(task: &CronTask) {
//!     let _lock = WakeLock::acquire(&format!("cron task {}", task.id)).ok();
//!     // _lock is dropped at end of scope, releasing the assertion.
//!     do_work().await;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `.ok()` is intentional — wake-lock failure should never abort the caller.
//! A non-acquired lock is functionally identical to "just running without
//! wake-lock", which is what we had before this module.
