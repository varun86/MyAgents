//! "Open in Finder/Explorer" + "Open with default app".
//!
//! Four commands:
//! - `cmd_workspace_open_in_finder` — workspace-relative path, reveals in OS
//!   file manager (`open -R` / `explorer /select,` / `xdg-open <parent>`).
//! - `cmd_workspace_open_with_default` — workspace-relative path, hands off
//!   to the OS default-app dispatcher.
//! - `cmd_open_path_external` (Phase D.5) — absolute path, used by the
//!   Skill/Command detail panels to reveal `~/.myagents/skills/...` files
//!   that live OUTSIDE any chat workspace. Validated against `home_dir` /
//!   `tmp_dir` prefix (mirrors sidecar `/agent/open-path`) so a malicious
//!   absolute path can't escape into `/etc` or similar.
//! - `cmd_open_path_with_default` (issue #125) — absolute path, opens with
//!   the OS default app. Used by BrowserPanel's "open in external browser"
//!   button when previewing a local HTML file. Same safety surface as
//!   `cmd_open_path_external` (canonicalize + home/tmp prefix + credential
//!   blacklist) — only the spawn target differs (`open <path>` vs `open -R`).
//!   The renderer's `openExternal()` helper detects `file://` URLs and
//!   absolute paths and routes through this command, because Tauri's
//!   `shell:allow-open` scope regex `^((mailto:\w+)|(tel:\w+)|(https?://\w+)).+`
//!   rejects both. v0.2.7 had a partial fix that extracted the bare path
//!   from `file://` and called `shell.open(<path>)` — that also failed the
//!   regex (and produced `/C:/...` paths on Windows).
//!
//! Issue #125 follow-up: both `cmd_open_path_external` and
//! `cmd_open_path_with_default` accept an optional `workspace` argument.
//! When the caller is operating inside a chat workspace (BrowserPanel
//! previewing a workspace HTML file, SkillDetailPanel revealing a
//! project-scoped skill at `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/`, etc.), the
//! workspace root is canonicalized and added as a third trusted prefix
//! alongside home/tmp. Otherwise Windows users with workspaces on `D:\`
//! (or any non-system drive / mapped drive) hit `Path not allowed` because
//! `D:\workspace\foo.html` doesn't start with `USERPROFILE` (typically
//! `C:\Users\...`) nor with `%TEMP%`.
//!
//! The home-anchored credential blacklist (`<home>/.ssh`, `<home>/.aws`,
//! `Library/Keychains`, …) still applies. It does NOT cover credential
//! dirs placed inside the workspace (`<workspace>/.ssh/`) — that's
//! consistent with the rest of the app's blacklist, which keys on the
//! current user's home dir. The two extra workspace-arg defenses
//! (filesystem-root rejection + canonicalized system-blacklist check)
//! exist to keep `workspace = "/"` or `workspace = "/private"` from
//! turning the home-anchored blacklist into the only line of defense.
//!
//! All variants fire-and-forget — the spawned command's stdout/stderr is
//! dropped deliberately so we don't block the IPC reply. Rust
//! `process_cmd::new` is used (not raw `std::process::Command`) so Windows
//! builds suppress the console-window flash per the CLAUDE.md red-line.
