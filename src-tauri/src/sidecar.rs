//
// Two pattern sets, sharing a common `CHILD_CLEANUP_PATTERNS` base:
//
// * [`STARTUP_CLEANUP_PATTERNS`] additionally sweeps sidecars by
//   [`SIDECAR_MARKER`]. Startup cleanup runs only when `acquire_lock`
//   reports a prior instance — in that scenario the prior instance is
//   already dead (SIGKILL'd by our lock code or crashed), so any matching
//   sidecar must be an orphan we legitimately own.
//
// * [`CHILD_CLEANUP_PATTERNS`] (used by [`cleanup_child_processes`] during
//   shutdown) deliberately **does not** sweep by `SIDECAR_MARKER`. Our
//   own sidecars are killed via their `Child` handles in
//   [`stop_all_sidecars`] — sweeping by marker here would potentially
//   kill a concurrent MyAgents instance's sidecars during any
//   hypothetical overlap window (single-instance plugin makes this
//   extremely rare but not architecturally impossible, e.g. during an
//   update handoff).
//
// All forward-slash form — the matcher in `process_cleanup` normalizes
// `\` → `/` and lowercases both sides before comparison.

// being killed. The barrier is set up once at app start and, in the vast

// spawn is requested (cleanup is ~50 ms when there's nothing to kill).
